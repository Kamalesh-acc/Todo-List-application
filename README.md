# Simple Todo List Prototype

Welcome to the Simple Todo List Prototype! This project is a basic implementation of a todo list application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It serves as a prototype for a future task manager app that will be upgraded with the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack.
